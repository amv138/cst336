   <strong>Java Basics</strong>
   
    Java is the most popular and used programming language out there. This is due
    to it's versatility and compatibility. Java can be used for many things, ranging
    from software development to mobile applications. Java is a fairly easy to learn
    high level programming language due to it not having complex features such as 
    operator overloading and multiple inheritance, pointers and memory allocation. 
    Dynamic memory is automatically handled for you unlike in C++, meaning memory 
    leaks are avoided!
    
    Java is a very relaible programming language. It is developed with an emphasis
    on checking for possible errors. The java compiler is able to detect difficult 
    errors that other programming language cannot.
