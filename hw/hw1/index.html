    Welcome to your first programming lesson!
                
    Before we start jumping into coding basics, I want to give a quick overview 
    of the history of programming!
                
    The first high level languages were languages such as<b> Fortran</b> and COBOL.
    Initially they were designed to solve math or business problems. High level 
    programming languages make it easier for programmers to understand and write 
    rather than writing in assembly languange.
