   <strong>What is programming?</strong>
                
    Before we start jumping into the basics, I want to give a quick overview 
    of programming and what this short lesson will cover!
                
    Programming/Coding is the process of creating software. Software is a set of
    instructions that tells the computer what to do. These instructions are
    written in an english like language called a "high level languange".
    Programming is writing instructions for a computer to perform. These
    instructions are called "source code" and are written in langauges such as 
    <mark>C++</mark> and <mark>Java</mark>, then we use something called a 
    <mark>Compiler </mark> to translate these instructions into something the 
    computer can understand.
