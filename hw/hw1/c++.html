   <strong>C++ Basics</strong>
                
    C++ is a high level language that is a derivative of C. C++ is considered 
    to be an improved version of C because of it's object oriented programming, 
    exception handling and many other ease of use features. It is a general use
    language meaning that is can be used for developing a wide range of 
    applications. 
    
    <strong><u>Features of C++ </u></strong>
    1.) <strong>Better memory management</strong>, C++ allows you to dynamically
    allocate memory during runtime using the new and delete operator which 
    provides stronger data handling. 
    2.)<strong>Portability</strong> Most C++ compilers support ANSI standards which
    increases the portability of C++, meaning you can write the source code on one 
    operating system and run it on another without having to make changes. 
    3.) <strong>Object Oriented</strong> Unlike C, C++ has OOP features, meaning
    you have concepts such as Abstraction, Inheritance and Encapsulation which
    makes writing large scale programs much more efficient.
